## A Quick Tutorial on using a linux terminal

In this Tutorial we are going to cover few main commands that will be used extensively in class. 
To begin open a new terminal. To open a terminal, find the launcher and then type terminal. Click on the terminal icon to open the terminal. 

The aim of this tutorial is to equip you with the required commands so that you can navigate to the nyu_finger directory stored in your PC. We will then download the lab exercises for this course in this location. You will be using this commands every class to run your code ! So feel free to comeback to it whenever you forget something. 

The four commands that we are going to learn are 

1. ls : ls is short for list. This command shows all the folders in the current location. To see what folders are in your current location type ls in your terminal and press ENTER. 

2. cd : cd is short for change directory. We use this command to navigate into a desired folder. For example to go into the devel folder in your pc, type cd ./devel and press ENTER. This will take you from the root directory into the devel directory. Now continue to use ls and cd commands to navigate to the nyu_finger directory. 

3. mkdir : this command is short for make a directory. Use this command to create a directory with the names of your team members. That is type mkdir yourname_yourteamatename and press ENTER.
